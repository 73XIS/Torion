        <p className='p__opensans'>Torion Recording Studio is the result of association between two musicians / sound engineers : Nimrod Szedlacsek and Albert Andr치s. They are former classmates, bandmates and even more: good friends. Both of them are aiming towards excellence in everything they do. The goal of the two is to bring music production to professional level by deploying know-how, high end gear, acoustically treated studio rooms, seriousness, reliability. Their motto: Creating Musical Perfection encompasses the drive to help every client reach their maximum potential</p>

        <p className='p__opensans'>Designed and built by Nimrod, the studio was originally started in 2014 by Nimrod and J치nky Zsolt. During the years, the recording gear was constantly upgraded, including the purchase of an Amek Angela M42 mixing desk. In 2022 J치nky Zsolt took a different road, and Albert Andr치s stepped in as co-owner. We were privileged to work with many national and international artists, such as Grimus, Teodora Enache, Funkorporation, Marius Moga, Altar, The Dream Centre (UK), Wirbelsturm (Austria), Detlef Cologne (Germany), Steelover (Belgium). </p>
